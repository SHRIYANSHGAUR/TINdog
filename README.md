TinDog WEB-Site
I created this as a CODE-CHALLENGE during my Web-Development Course 
IN this I have used Bootstrap framework to implement various functionalities of an ENGAGING and RESPONSIVE WEB-Site

It just has Front end with HTML/CSS but in its DESIGN ,I imployed  some of my User-Experience know-how, and had fun making it.
